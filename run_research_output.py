test_output = ['Manchester United completed the signings of Matthijs De Ligt and Noussair Mazraoui from Bayern Munich, with the deal estimated to be around 50-60 million including add-ons. The duo made their debuts in a 1-0 win over Fulham, and their arrival is expected to alter United\'s style, pace, and defensive structure. While Mazraoui\'s departure from Bayern Munich is viewed with less controversy due to his limited game time, De Ligt\'s transfer is seen as a major loss by fans and the Bavarian Football Works community. De Ligt was a standout performer under Nagelsmann, and Mazraoui, despite his struggles with game time and a heart complication, showed consistent quality. Mazraoui\'s lack of physicality may be a challenge in the Premier League, and De Ligt\'s conservative passing could limit tactical versatility. De Ligt failed to fully meet Thomas Tuchel\'s requirements for a ball-playing center-back, and Mazraoui\'s public comments on Middle Eastern politics stirred controversy. At Manchester United, De Ligt is expected to enhance the defense and contribute to the build-up play, while Mazraoui\'s versatility and ability in tight spaces could prove beneficial. The transfer ranks highest in favor for Manchester United, followed by the players due to the potential for increased game time and familiarity under Ten Hag, and least favorable for Bayern Munich due to the quality lost. Overall, the deal is seen as excellent for Manchester United, who acquired top-tier talent at a relatively low cost.', 'Barcelona coach Hansi Flick addressed the situation with Ilkay G√ºndogan after the midfielder missed the team\'s LaLiga opener against Valencia. Despite reports suggesting G√ºndogan wanted to leave the club, Flick said the player sat out due to precautionary reasons after a head injury sustained in a friendly against Monaco. Flick confirmed he had spoken with G√ºndogan and believes the German international will stay at the club. Sources close to G√ºndogan confirmed he experienced headaches and dizziness in training, which led to him missing the match. In his absence, Barcelona\'s youthful side secured a 2-1 victory, with Robert Lewandowski scoring twice after Valencia initially took the lead. With other key players like Gavi and Frenkie de Jong also sidelined, Flick relied on young La Masia talents, including Marc Bernal, Marc Casad√≥, and Lamine Yamal, all of whom impressed in the victory. Flick acknowledged the team\'s struggles in the first half but was pleased with their improvement and resilience in the second, noting that while there is room for growth, the win was well deserved.']
